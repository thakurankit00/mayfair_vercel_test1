# 🚀 Dual Environment Deployment - Deploy to Both at Once!

## 🎯 Revolutionary Checkbox Approach

The **"Deploy Any Branch - Dual Environment"** workflow introduces a game-changing feature: **checkbox-based environment selection**! You can now deploy to **both environments simultaneously** with a single workflow run.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔥 **Checkbox Selection**
- ✅ **Deploy to Preview** (dev.mayfairmandi.com)
- ✅ **Deploy to Production** (prod.mayfairmandi.com)
- ✅ **Deploy to Both** (check both boxes!)

### 🚀 **Simultaneous Deployment**
- Deploy to **preview only** for testing
- Deploy to **production only** for releases
- Deploy to **both environments** for major updates
- **Validation**: At least one environment must be selected

### 🛡️ **Smart Workflow Logic**
- **Conditional steps**: Only runs deployment for selected environments
- **Independent deployments**: Preview and production deploy separately
- **Detailed reporting**: Shows status for each environment
- **Error isolation**: If one fails, the other can still succeed

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Validation Step
```yaml
- name: 🔍 Validate deployment selection
  run: |
    if [ "${{ github.event.inputs.deploy_preview }}" != "true" ] && 
       [ "${{ github.event.inputs.deploy_production }}" != "true" ]; then
      echo "❌ Error: At least one environment must be selected!"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### Conditional Deployment Steps
```yaml
- name: 🚀 Deploy to Preview Environment
  if: ${{ github.event.inputs.deploy_preview == 'true' }}
  # ... deployment logic

- name: 🌟 Deploy to Production Environment
  if: ${{ github.event.inputs.deploy_production == 'true' }}
  # ... deployment logic
```

### Smart Summary Generation
The workflow dynamically generates summaries based on which environments were deployed, showing only relevant information.
